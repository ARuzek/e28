## Outside resources

I needed a reminder on how to do the loops in Vue.
<https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/#Conditionals-and-Loops>

I wasn't quite sure how to do a timer, but I knew it was something with setInterval something.
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval>

I knew I wanted to dynamically put in the images on the for-loop so I wanted an example of that.

I had to make the font fit the spooky game. :)

## Notes for instructor

1. I illustrated these rooms myself for fun.
2. It's basically just an elaborate coin flip, so to increase the odds of getting through the first room, wait at least a second or two before clicking your choice because of the pseudo-random Math.random
