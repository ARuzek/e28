## Notes for instructor

I did have some trouble with testing as you'll see. It doesn't hold the logged in state, so I couldn't test logged in features as much as I'd wanted to. In addition, the registration form thinks one of the fields is disabled for some reason. In retrospect, I should have allowed myself more time to ask about these issues.
